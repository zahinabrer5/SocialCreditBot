# Social Credit Discord Bot

**Note**: the bot was designed to only run in a main server and a test server.

Required environment variables include: `TOKEN`, `OWNER_ID` and `DEVELOPER_ID` (the rest can be inferred from the source
code).

Visit https://discord.com/developers/applications to make a Discord Application (a bot account) to run the bot on.
